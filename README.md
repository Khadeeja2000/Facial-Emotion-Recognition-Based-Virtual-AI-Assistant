## System Limitations

### Methodological
- Emotion-mental health correlations based on research approximations
- Single-modal input (facial expressions only)
- No temporal persistence analysis
- Not validated on clinical populations

### Technical
- Requires good lighting conditions
- Processes one face at a time
- Static correlations (no personalization)
- Internet required for therapeutic content

## Ethical Considerations

- **Not for Clinical Diagnosis**: This is a screening and wellness tool only
- **Privacy**: Facial data is processed locally and not stored
- **Disclaimers**: Users should be informed about system limitations
- **Professional Help**: System encourages seeking professional mental health support

## Future Enhancements

- Clinical validation with patient populations
- Multi-modal fusion (facial + voice + physiological)
- Temporal pattern analysis for emotion persistence
- Personalization algorithms for individual differences
- Integration with validated clinical assessment scales

## Research Contributions

- Complete ML pipeline with proper validation methodology
- Real-time integration of emotion recognition with mental health assessment
- Evidence-based explanation system for transparency
