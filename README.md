## System Architecture

```
Camera Input → FER2013 Emotion Detection → RAVDESS Mental Health Models → 
Evidence-based Analysis → Virtual AI Assistant → Therapeutic Interventions
```

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Webcam (720p minimum)
- 8GB RAM recommended
- Internet connection for therapeutic content

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.15.0
pip install keras==2.15.0
pip install opencv-python==4.8.0
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.0
pip install pygame==2.5.0
pip install pandas==2.0.0
pip install numpy==1.24.0
```

## Usage

### 1. Train RAVDESS Mental Health Models

First, ensure you have the RAVDESS dataset in `datasets/ravdess/facial_landmarks/`:

```bash
python ravdess_mental_health_trainer.py
```

This will:
- Process 2,452 RAVDESS facial landmark samples
- Train Random Forest models for depression, anxiety, and stress
- Save trained models to `trained_models/` directory
- Generate performance metrics

### 2. Run the Integrated System

```bash
python fer_ravdess_integrated_system.py
```

The system will:
- Start real-time emotion detection using your webcam
- Analyze mental health indicators using trained RAVDESS models
- Monitor for exactly 1 minute
- Display interactive popup with therapeutic content options

### 3. Test Individual Components

Test FER2013 emotion recognition only:
```bash
python real_time_video.py
```

## Technical Details

### FER2013 Emotion Detection
- **Model**: Mini-XCEPTION CNN
- **Accuracy**: 77% on FER2013 dataset
- **Emotions**: angry, disgust, scared, happy, sad, surprised, neutral
- **Processing Speed**: 30+ FPS real-time

### RAVDESS Mental Health Models
- **Dataset**: 2,452 professional actor samples
- **Algorithms**: Random Forest (selected via cross-validation)
- **Conditions**: Depression, Anxiety, Stress
- **Training**: 70/30 split with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Features**: 22 engineered features per sample

### Emotion-Mental Health Correlations
```python
emotion_mental_health_mapping = {
    'sad': {'depression': 0.90, 'anxiety': 0.25, 'stress': 0.35},
    'angry': {'depression': 0.35, 'anxiety': 0.45, 'stress': 0.95},
    'fearful': {'depression': 0.25, 'anxiety': 0.95, 'stress': 0.55},
    # ... additional mappings
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Real-time Processing**: <50ms per frame
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB
- **Model Loading**: <5 seconds
- **Monitoring Cycle**: Exactly 60 seconds

## System Workflow

1. **Camera Initialization**: System starts webcam and loads models
2. **Real-time Analysis**: Processes video frames for emotion and mental health
3. **1-minute Monitoring**: Accumulates analysis data over 60 seconds
4. **Evidence Generation**: Creates explanations for all predictions
5. **Intervention Popup**: Shows interactive interface with therapeutic options
6. **Content Delivery**: Opens selected therapeutic content (videos, music, podcasts)

## Therapeutic Content

The system provides evidence-based therapeutic content:

- **Videos**: Meditation, breathing exercises, mood enhancement
- **Music**: Calming playlists, stress relief, uplifting content
- **Podcasts**: Mental health discussions, coping strategies, wellness tips

Content sources include YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts with 2024 updated links.

## Limitations

### Methodological
- Emotion-mental health correlations based on research approximations
- Single-modal input (facial expressions only)
- No temporal persistence analysis
- Not validated on clinical populations

### Technical
- Requires good lighting conditions
- Processes one face at a time
- Static correlations (no personalization)
- Internet required for therapeutic content

## Research Contributions

- Complete ML pipeline with proper validation methodology
- Real-time integration of emotion recognition with mental health assessment
- Evidence-based explanation system for transparency
- Professional therapeutic intervention interface

## Ethical Considerations

- **Not for Clinical Diagnosis**: This is a screening and wellness tool only
- **Privacy**: Facial data is processed locally and not stored
- **Disclaimers**: Users should be informed about system limitations
- **Professional Help**: System should encourage seeking professional mental health support when appropriate

## Future Work

- Clinical validation with patient populations
- Multi-modal fusion (facial + voice + physiological)
- Temporal pattern analysis for emotion persistence
- Personalization algorithms for individual differences
- Integration with validated clinical assessment scales
